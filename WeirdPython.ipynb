    "Remember that we don't do any recursion here, but iteratio. But still, we do have a somewhat similar structure of conditions: The first conditions says that we're done simplifying/evaluating the current expression to atoms, and can apply the command to the arguments and get a result. The other condition is again the one that decomposes the expression further and descends the syntax tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the main difference here is that we descend and ascend the tree without recursion, so we have to keep track of the `curr_exp` we are working on, and of any results so far (`curr_atoms`). We note down our state of affairs in the current expression before we deal with a subexpression (the part dealing with `stack_frame`). And, vice-versa, once we're done with a subexpression, we get the state from the superexpression (`stack.pop()`), add the subexpression's result atom to it, and continue with its remaining unevaluated items.\n",

    "Calling functions from other functions is most common -- but it's just one of several ways. It works with a call stack that gets another environment layer (a.k.a. stack frame) pushed on top with each function call (the environment contains the passed arguments and any local variables). That way, we get a fresh, clean environment with only locals in each function, and when we return (and pop the env from the stack), we're right we're we left of in the calling function. But that means that doing real math in a style like inc(inc(inc(...))) would grow to the stack quite significantly and eventually overflow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can be more explicit in what we want to happen next. Continuation-passing style is one of them. There, we give a function that we want to use not only its arguments, but also another function that it should call with the result (we can also pass it continuations for error handling). In the days of pre-Promise (a.k.a. Promise) web dev, something similar was quite common and lovingly called \"callback hell\" (because for chains of things-to-do-with-results-of-things-to-do, you got {a {lot {of {nested {function {bodies}}}}}}).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem (depending on the language, certainly in Python) is also that when naively calling 1000 consecutive continuations one from another, we'll risk blowing up the stack (even though we don't need it).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, somewhat more sophisticated ways of handling this type of stuff, even in Python."

    "\n",
    "Other programming languages support a type of ad-hoc polymorphism called function overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it possible to use the same function to perform an operation on different numbers of arguments and different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a function \"add(a, b)\" could be implemented so it supports the addition of numbers, joining strings, appending lists, etc.\n",
    "This is particularly useful if the operation has semantic similarities in those data types (that differ only in the concrete implementation), e.g. there is an empty element, an identity operation, and the transformation of one argument of the type to a result of the same type, but modified by another argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python does not support function overloading, it does support polymorphism through classes and objects: You can define different classes (or subclasses) like \"RationalNumber\" and \"ComplexNumber\" that have methods of the same name, so users can just use them without having to know which object they are dealing with. To make this simpler, many Python operators like `=`, `+` etc. have special names that you can use in your classes: `__eq__`, `__add__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't need (or want) to write classes, Python does not have your back this time.\n",
