# weird_python

This notebook is meant as a fun little adventure for those who have been using Python for a bit and want to see some of the rabbitholes it has to offer.

In fact, almost any programming language offers these rabbit holes. They are, by their very nature, inherent to what we call "programming".

Or, as we might also call it, magic.
